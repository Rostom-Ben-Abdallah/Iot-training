# IoT Training Session  
Welcome to the **IoT Training Session**! In this guide, you will learn how to set up and test **Mosquitto MQTT Broker** on a Windows machine.

---

## **1. Installing Mosquitto MQTT Broker (Windows)**  
### **Download Mosquitto**  
Choose the appropriate version based on your system architecture:  
- **64-bit**: [Download mosquitto-2.0.18-install-windows-x64.exe](https://mosquitto.org/files/binary/win64/mosquitto-2.0.18-install-windows-x64.exe)  
- **32-bit**: [Download mosquitto-2.0.18-install-windows-x32.exe](https://mosquitto.org/files/binary/win32/mosquitto-2.0.18-install-windows-x86.exe)  

---

### **Installation Steps**  
1. Download the installer for your system from the links above.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, proceed to configure Mosquitto.

---

## **2. Configuring Mosquitto**  
### **Locate the Configuration File**  
The configuration file is located at:  
```
C:\Program Files\mosquitto\mosquitto.conf
```

### **Modify the Configuration**  
Open the `mosquitto.conf` file with a text editor (e.g., Notepad) and make the following changes:
- Add the following lines:  
  ```plaintext
  listener 1883
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

### **Save the File**  
Save the file after making these changes.

---

## **3. Running Mosquitto Broker**  
1. Open **Command Prompt** as **Administrator**.
2. Navigate to the Mosquitto installation directory:  
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Program Files\mosquitto"
   ```
3. Start the Mosquitto service:  
   ```bash
   net start mosquitto
   ```

### **Verify Installation**  
To ensure Mosquitto is running correctly, use the following command:  
```bash
mosquitto -v
```
This should display log output indicating the broker is running.

---

## **4. Testing the MQTT Broker**  
### **In Command Prompt, open two terminals:**

#### **Step 1: Find Your IP Address**  
If you're not using `localhost`, you can use your broker's IP address by checking your system's IP address:  
1. Open a new Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
3. Look for your **IPv4 Address** (e.g., `192.168.x.x`). This is your local IP address.

---

#### **Step 2: Subscribe to a Topic**  
In the first terminal, run the following command to subscribe to a topic:  
- Using `localhost`:  
  ```bash
  mosquitto_sub -h "localhost" -t "test/topic"
  ```
- Using your **IP address**:  
  ```bash
  mosquitto_sub -h "192.168.x.x" -t "test/topic"
  ```

---

#### **Step 3: Publish a Message**  
In the second terminal, run the following command to publish a message:  
- Using `localhost`:  
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -h "localhost" -t "test/topic" -m "Hello, MQTT!"
  ```
- Using your **IP address**:  
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -h "192.168.x.x" -t "test/topic" -m "Hello, MQTT!"
  ```

---

### **5. Notes and Best Practices**  
- Ensure the **IP address** and **topic name** are correct when using the commands.
- Use the `-r` argument in the `mosquitto_pub` command to retain the message:  
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -h "192.168.x.x" -t "test/topic" -m "Hello, MQTT!" -r
  ```
- Verify the connection between publisher and subscriber by checking if the message appears in the subscribed terminal.

---

### **6. Troubleshooting**  
1. If Mosquitto fails to start, ensure:
   - You ran Command Prompt as an administrator.
   - The `mosquitto.conf` file is correctly modified and saved.
2. Verify your network connection and ensure the IP address is accurate.
